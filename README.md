- [x] [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) (preferred under Linux)
- [x] [JavaFX SDK](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/) 

## ‚è≥ Quick installation setup
For a fast setup, follow these steps:
- Replace <path-to-javafx-sdk\> with the actual path to your JavaFX SDK.
- Replace <os-name\> with your OS name/abbreviation. Accepted values are: **linux**, **mac**, **win**.
```bash
JAVAFX_SDK="<path-to-javafx-sdk>/lib"
OS="-<os-name>"
```
Then, copy and paste the following block into your terminal.
```bash
git clone https://gitlab.univ-lorraine.fr/bouraoui9u/projet-de-synthese.git
cd projet-de-synthese
mkdir -p obj
if [ "$OS" = "-linux" ]; then OS=""; fi

```bash
cd java
javac --module-path lib:<path-to-javafx-sdk>/lib -d bin src/**/*.java
```

### Launching the JavaFX Interface
To open the JavaFX interface via Terminal, first replace <path-to-javafx-sdk> with the actual path to your JavaFX SDK:

## üí´ Scripts
### generate_instances.sh
**generate_instances.sh** is a Bash script designed to generate an instance of the scheduling problem.

### Usage
You can execute the script by running the following command in the terminal:
```bash
bash generate_instance.sh [output_file] [number_of_tasks] [release_date]
```

#### Parameters
- **output_file**: The name of the file to be created.
- **number_of_tasks**: The number of tasks to be created.
- **release_date**: The parameter used in the generation of release dates.

#### Example
Here is an example command:
```bash
bash generate_instance.sh output.txt 100 0.2
```
This will create a new instance of a scheduling problem with 100 tasks. The generated instance will be written to a file named output.txt. The parameter used in generating the task release dates is 0.2.

#### Output
The generated instance will be written to a file with the following format:
```
job_id processing_time release_date
```
***
### generate_collection.sh
This script generates a collection of instances for a scheduling problem.

### Usage
You can execute the script by running the following command in the terminal:
```bash
bash generate_collection.sh [OPTIONS]
```

#### Parameters
The script accepts the following ***optional*** parameters:

**-d DIR_NAME**: The name of the directory where the new instances will be saved. Default is collection.
**-j MIN:MAX:STEP**: Defines the number of tasks to be used in the instances. The script generates instances with numbers of tasks ranging from MIN to MAX, in steps of STEP. For example, "20:40:10" will generate instances with 20, 30, and 40 tasks.
**-t MIN:MAX:STEP**: Defines the parameter related to the random generation of task release dates. It varies for different instances and is given in a MIN:MAX:STEP format. For example, "0.1:0.2:0.1" will generate instances with t=0.1 and 0.2.
**-i NUM**: The number of different instances to be generated for each combination of j and t parameters.

#### Example
Here is an example command:
```bash
bash generate_collection.sh -d myCollection -j 50:200:50 -t 0.1:0.5:0.1 -i 5
```
This command will create a collection of instances of a scheduling problem. The instances will be stored in a directory named myCollection. The script will generate instances with 50, 100, 150, and 200 tasks (as specified by -j 50:200:50). The parameter used in generating the task release dates will vary between 0.1 and 0.5 with a step of 0.1 (as specified by -t 0.1:0.5:0.1). For each combination of the number of tasks and release date parameter, 5 instances will be generated (as specified by -i 5).

All the parameters provided in the command are optional. If not provided, the script will use the default values.
***

### run_experiments.sh
**run_experiments.sh** is a Bash script designed to execute an experimental campaign over a collection of instances.

### Usage
```bash
bash run_experiments.sh [directory] [results_file] [min_machines] [max_machines] [step_machines]
```
#### Parameters
- **directory**: The name of the directory containing the instances on which the experiments will be run. The directory should be located in the same folder as the script, or a relative/absolute path to it should be provided.
- **results_file**: The name of the file where the results of the experiments will be written. If the file doesn't exist, the script will create it. If it does exist, the script will overwrite it.
- **min_machines**: The minimum number of machines to use in the experiments. This should be a positive integer.
- **max_machines**: The maximum number of machines to use in the experiments. This should be a positive integer greater than or equal to min_machines.
- **step_machines**: The step size for incrementing the number of machines to use. This means that the experiments will be run with min_machines, then min_machines + step_machines, and so on, up to max_machines.

#### Example
To run an experimental campaign on instances in the 'collection' directory with 1 to 100 machines in steps of 10, storing the results in 'results.txt', you would use:
```bash
bash run_experiments.sh collection results.txt 1 100 10
```

#### Output
The results of the experiments will be written to a file with the following format:
```
[T Value] [Instance Number] [Number of Machines] [Non-preemptive Non-balanced Makespan] [Non-preemptive Non-balanced CPU Time] [Non-preemptive Balanced Makespan] [Non-preemptive Balanced CPU Time] [Preemptive Non-balanced Makespan] [Preemptive Non-balanced CPU Time] [Preemptive Balanced Makespan] [Preemptive Balanced CPU Time]
```

###### Here is the output explaination:
- **T Value**: This is the ratio of the sum of all task times to the total available machine time.

- **Instance Number**: This number uniquely identifies the instance within the collection.

- **Number of Machines**: This is the count of machines used in each instance.

- **Non-preemptive Non-balanced Makespan**: This represents the total time from the start to the completion of all tasks for the non-preemptive, non-balanced tree configuration of the algorithm.

- **Non-preemptive Non-balanced CPU Time**: This is the time taken by the CPU to compute the schedule for the non-preemptive, non-balanced tree configuration of the algorithm.

- **Non-preemptive Balanced Makespan**: This represents the total time from the start to the completion of all tasks for the non-preemptive, balanced tree configuration of the algorithm.

- **Non-preemptive Balanced CPU Time**: This is the time taken by the CPU to compute the schedule for the non-preemptive, balanced tree configuration of the algorithm.

- **Preemptive Non-balanced Makespan**: This represents the total time from the start to the completion of all tasks for the preemptive, non-balanced tree configuration of the algorithm.

- **Preemptive Non-balanced CPU Time**: This is the time taken by the CPU to compute the schedule for the preemptive, non-balanced tree configuration of the algorithm.

- **Preemptive Balanced Makespan**: This represents the total time from the start to the completion of all tasks for the preemptive, balanced tree configuration of the algorithm.

- **Preemptive Balanced CPU Time**: This is the time taken by the CPU to compute the schedule for the preemptive, balanced tree configuration of the algorithm.

# Compile expe
```bash
make expe
```

The script `script/expe` can be used to run a series of tests on the scheduling algorithm. The script takes the following arguments:
```bash
./script/expe <num_machines> <num_instances> <num_tasks> <num_releases> <num_preemptions> <num_balanced> <num_runs>
```
The script will run the algorithm on a series of randomly generated instances and print the results to the file `data/expe.csv`. The script will also print the average execution time of the algorithm to the terminal.
